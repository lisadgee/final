    <h3>Introduction to William's Hobbies</h3>
    <p class="quote">As stated by Phyllis McGinley on &nbsp;<cite><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/phyllis_mcginley_140820">Brainy Quote</a></cite>.
      <q class="quote">A hobby a day keeps the doldrums away.</q>
    </p>
   <p>Most people have one or two hobbies; some have none.  William’s situation is probably
    unusual.  He has six!  While he has gone through stages in life where he could not always
    remain active with them, he has never lost an interest in the things that he considers to
    be his passion.
    <br>
    <br>
    It would make sense that he was heavily engaged in these hobbies when he was younger,
    single, and childless.  He obviously had a lot more free time to focus on leisure
    activities.  But once he got married, had children, and had to hold down a full-time job,
    that part of his life had to be put on hold.  It is only recently that William has felt
    comfortable with the age and independence of his daughters enough to get back to the
    things that he enjoys the most.
     <br>
     <br>
    In no specific order, William’s hobbies are playing video games, running, bike riding,
    learning, playing guitar and sailing.
