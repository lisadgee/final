         William Rowland Gee, III, known as “Rowland,” lives in Ashburn, Virginia, with his family.  He graduated from Parkview High School
         and attended several colleges before graduating from Strayer University with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science.
         He paid for his own college education by working several jobs in the construction industry while taking classes at night.  It
         was at Strayer where he met his wife, Lisa, whom he would marry a year and a half later.
         <br>
         <br>
         Rowland started graduate school at Howard University a year after earning his BS degree.  He earned his Master of Business (MBA) 2 years later.
         At the graduation ceremony, he was called to the stage unexpectedly and presented with an award for being the first student in the history of
         the commencement of the MBA program in 1868 to achieve and maintain a 4.0-grade point average.  That same week, he and his wife found out that
         they were having their second daughter.
         <br>
         <br>
         Rowland is currently a successful senior-level chief architect/engineer working as a Northern Virginia government contractor.
         He is currently enrolled at George Mason University, earning his second Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
         He is interested in transitioning into the biological/medical field but prefers to stay within the technical sector, where he can leverage
         his existing skills and talent.
         <br>
         <br>
         Bioinformatics and Computational Biology involve collecting, storing, analyzing, and presenting complex biological data.
         The Covid pandemic piqued his interest in this field. It made him want to make a difference by contributing to the technical
         research and study of disease detection, drug design, and modeling biosystems.
